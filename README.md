# youth-exchange

This serverless function receives data from [this userscript](https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/494188-mz-track-youth-exchange-players) and saves it to Firebase. The data can be viewed [here](https://u18mz.vercel.app/16). Originally developed as a Kotlin backend service, it has now been refactored into a Google Cloud Function for simplicity.
